It depends on the road test, but in my case, it usually goes like this:

- (1hr) Collecting information about the Roadtest (a fast review)
  - 1hr
- (5hrs) Thinking about the Roadtest HowTo (if it catches my interest)
  - Collecting more information about the Roadtest (datasheets, videos, forums, ...) (**4hr**)
  - First sketch planning (**1hr**)
  - All this is done over the course of 1~2 week
- (3hrs) Applying to the RoadTest
  - Draft (**20min**)
  - Feasibility (e.g. check resources I have like time, components, time ...) (**1hr**)
  - Proposal (if feasibility was OK) (**1hr**)
  - Final review (**30min**)
  - This is done over the course of a week
- (15~110hrs) Doing the road test (this varies a lot depending on the project)
  - Initial Setup (**1~2hr**)
  - Scriptwriting (e.g. writing done in a more formal plan) (**4~8hr**)
  - Hands-on (writing code - firmware, gateware, software, ...) (**4~40hr**)
  - Testing (aka playing with the device) (**2~20hr**)
  - Recording and documenting (aka actual Roadtest) (**4~40hr**)
  - This is done over the course of 1~4 month
- (4~9hr) Posting
  - Reviewing notes (**40min**)
  - Video Editing (**1~5hr**)
  - First Draft (**1~2hr**)
  - Review (**1hr**)
  - Final Review (**20min**)

So in total between 28~128 hrs given or taken:

- 3.5~16 days (8hr day)
- These are "*real*" data (I usually time myself)

and yes, you can see that I am a project manager ;) - as a side note, this post took me ~20min (going back and forward reviewing some old notes)
